Deploy and manage your entire Cloudflare security stack from WordPress — WAF rules, DNS, zone analytics, cache control, IP blocking, security events, and email routing.

== Description ==

**WP WAF Manager** puts your entire Cloudflare setup inside WordPress. Deploy battle-tested WAF rules in one click, manage DNS, monitor traffic, purge cache, block IPs, and set up email forwarding — without ever opening the Cloudflare dashboard for day-to-day tasks.

= WAF Rules Builder =

Deploy five pre-configured, battle-tested security rules to any Cloudflare zone in one click, based on the open-source [wafrules.com](https://wafrules.com) ruleset:

* **Allow Good Bots** — Whitelist Cloudflare verified bot categories (Googlebot, Bingbot, uptime monitors, payment processors) plus a custom IP allowlist and custom user agent allowlist
* **Block Aggressive Crawlers** — Block SEO scrapers, exploit scanners (SQLMap, Nikto, Masscan, Nmap), and sensitive WordPress paths (xmlrpc.php, wp-config.php, install.php)
* **Block Web Hosts & TOR** — Block traffic from cloud hosting ASNs (DigitalOcean, Vultr, Hetzner, OVH, Contabo, and more) and TOR exit nodes
* **Challenge Large Cloud Providers** — Managed challenge for AWS EC2, Google Cloud, and Azure traffic
* **Challenge VPN & wp-login** — Managed challenge for NordVPN, ExpressVPN, Surfshark, and other VPN providers plus the WordPress login page

Additional: custom IP allowlist, live expression preview, multi-zone deployment, JSON export/import, automatic Free plan compatibility.

= DNS Manager =

Full DNS record management without leaving WordPress:

* 21 record types: A, AAAA, CAA, CERT, CNAME, DNSKEY, DS, HTTPS, LOC, MX, NAPTR, NS, PTR, SMIMEA, SPF, SRV, SSHFP, SVCB, TLSA, TXT, URI
* Add, edit, and delete records with type-aware form fields
* Cloudflare proxy toggle per record, TTL control, search and filter

= Zone Analytics =

Monitor all your Cloudflare zones from one page:

* 6 metrics per zone: Requests, Bandwidth, Cache Rate %, Pageviews, Threats, Cached Requests
* Powered by the Cloudflare GraphQL Analytics API
* Auto-sync via WP-Cron (off by default — enable in Settings)
* Zone picker: choose exactly which zones to monitor — starts empty, no surprise API calls on first install
* Analytics window from last 24 hours to 30 days

= Zone Controls =

Manage Cloudflare settings per zone from one dashboard:

* **Under Attack Mode** — toggle per zone, or enable across ALL zones instantly for DDoS emergencies
* **Development Mode** — toggle per zone
* **Cache Purge** — purge everything or specific URLs
* Per-zone settings: SSL mode, Always Use HTTPS, Security Level, Cache Level, Browser Cache TTL, Rocket Loader, Hotlink Protection, Email Obfuscation

= IP Access Rules =

Account-level IP rules that apply instantly across all zones:

* Target types: IP address, IP range (CIDR), Country code, ASN
* Actions: Allow, Block, Managed Challenge, JS Challenge
* Works with multiple accounts

= Security Events =

View recent Cloudflare firewall events per zone:

* Powered by the Cloudflare GraphQL Analytics API
* Filter by action (Block, Challenge, Allow, Skip…)
* Time range from 1 hour to 7 days, up to 500 events
* Requires Cloudflare Pro plan or higher

= Email Routing =

Manage Cloudflare Email Routing (free on all plans) without leaving WordPress:

* Enable or disable Email Routing per zone
* Add destination addresses and trigger Cloudflare verification emails
* Set specific forwarding rules (e.g. contact@yourdomain.com → you@gmail.com)
* Configure the Catch-All rule — forward all unmatched email to one inbox, with on/off toggle
* Sync button to refresh data after making changes

= Plugin Settings =

* Admin Bar Quick Purge — zone picker, instant AJAX purge or navigate to Zone Controls
* Zone analytics auto-sync interval and default time range
* Access control — minimum role picker (Administrator recommended)
* Menu visibility — hide Security Events, Email Routing, or the dashboard widget
* Keep data on uninstall toggle (on by default)
* Test Connection — verify API credentials instantly

= Multi-Account Support =

* Connect multiple Cloudflare accounts (API Token or Email + Global API Key)
* Switch accounts instantly with labels
* Configurable credential expiry

= WordPress Dashboard Widget =

A quick-glance card on the WP dashboard: account name, zones monitored, sync status, last sync time, and quick links. Toggle off in Settings if not needed.

= Requirements =

* WordPress 6.0 or later
* PHP 8.0 or later
* A Cloudflare account with at least one active zone
* API Token with: Zone → WAF → Edit, Zone → Zone → Read, Zone → DNS → Edit
* Account → Firewall Services → Edit (for IP Access Rules)
* Account → Email Routing Addresses → Edit (for Email Routing)
* Security Events requires a Cloudflare Pro plan or higher zone

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `wpwafmanager` folder to `/wp-content/plugins/` or install via Plugins → Add New → Upload Plugin
2. Activate via Plugins → Installed Plugins
3. Navigate to **WAF Manager** in the admin sidebar
4. Enter your Cloudflare API Token and click **Verify & Save**
5. Optionally go to **WAF Manager → License** and enter your Pro license key for automatic updates

= Creating Your API Token =

1. Visit [Cloudflare API Tokens](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens)
2. Click Create Token and use the "Edit zone DNS" template as a starting point
3. Add: Zone → WAF → Edit, Zone → DNS → Edit, Account → Firewall Services → Edit, Account → Email Routing Addresses → Edit
4. Set Zone Resources to "All zones" (or specify zones)
5. Copy the token into the plugin and click Verify & Save

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this work on Cloudflare Free plans? =

Yes — WAF Rules, DNS Manager, Zone Analytics, Zone Controls, IP Access Rules, and Email Routing all work on Free plans. Security Events requires a Pro plan or higher.

= Does this replace the Cloudflare dashboard? =

No — it handles the most common day-to-day tasks. Advanced configuration (Workers, Pages, R2, Bulk Redirects, etc.) still requires the Cloudflare dashboard. Email Routing setup (verifying destination addresses) also happens in the Cloudflare dashboard; this plugin manages your existing routing rules.

= Is my API key stored securely? =

Credentials are stored in your WordPress database with base64 obfuscation and autoload=false — they are never loaded on front-end page requests. Use an API Token with minimum required permissions rather than your Global API Key.

= Can I manage multiple client sites? =

Yes. Use the multi-account feature to connect each client's Cloudflare account. Switch between accounts from the WAF Rules page.

= What happens when I delete the plugin? =

By default, all data is kept (safe for testing or temporary removal). To have all plugin data removed on delete, go to Settings and disable "Keep data on uninstall" before deleting.

= What is the difference between free and Pro? =

The free version on GitHub is fully featured. Pro at [wpwafmanager.com](https://wpwafmanager.com) is available as a one-time purchase. It adds automatic plugin updates directly in your WP admin and priority support.

= Why are zones blank on first install? =

Zone Analytics starts with no zones selected and auto-sync off. This prevents surprise API calls to Cloudflare on first activation. Select your zones in Zone Analytics → Settings and enable auto-sync when ready.

== Changelog ==

= 1.0.8 – May 2026 =
* Security: email rule update handler now validates and sanitizes each field individually before passing to the Cloudflare API, rather than forwarding raw POST JSON
* Security: update notifier internal constants made private
* Performance: WPWAF_Settings::all() now caches in-request to avoid repeated get_option calls per page load
* Performance: IP access rule pagination converted from recursion to iterative loop, eliminating stack risk on accounts with many rules
* Performance: removed unused get_zone_settings() method that made 8 serial Cloudflare API calls (get_all_zone_settings() replaced it in a single call)
* Code: removed unreachable duplicate error-check block in security events GraphQL handler

= 1.0.7 – May 2026 =
* Rule 1 (Allow Good Bots): added Custom User Agents allowlist — enter user agent strings one per line to skip all WAF rules, identical pattern to the existing custom IP allowlist. Survives base rule updates.
* Added update notifier — free users see a dashboard notice when a new version is available on GitHub, with links to download free or upgrade to Pro for automatic updates. Pro users with an active license see nothing. Notice is dismissible and refreshes daily.
